# Fuse

Fuse is a compact tensor‑equation DSL and runtime that maps equations onto NumPy with optional Torch FX and JAX execution paths. It covers sources → IR → backends → sinks in a small, readable codebase.

- NumPy evaluator with fixpoint support and rich `explain()`
- Torch FX lowering and JAX executor with optional XLA callable
- File sources/sinks, caching, and runtime policies (weights, sharding, quant, LoRA)
