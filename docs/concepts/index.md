# Concepts

Key building blocks when working with Fuse:

- Program and IR: parse equations and build an intermediate representation
- ExecutionConfig: control precision, device, fixpoint mode, and projection
- Runners: NumPy evaluator, Torch FX lowering, JAX executor
- Policies: weight stores, sharding, quantization, and LoRA adapters

See the DSL Reference for grammar and operators, and the Backend Matrix for capabilities.
